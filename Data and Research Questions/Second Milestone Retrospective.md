Although we did not start the milestone with well-defined objectives, during Milestone 2, our group made significant progress in collecting, cleaning, and organizing the "social media and mental health" dataset for our collective project.
Here are some key aspects we still make progress in:

Domain Expertise: While we made efforts to understand the domain and select relevant data features, we could have consulted with domain experts to gain deeper insights into the nuances of social media usage and its impact on mental health.

Data Flaws Awareness: Although we identified and addressed some data flaws during cleaning, there may be other potential flaws or biases that we overlooked. Conducting a more comprehensive analysis of data quality could have been beneficial.

Future Data Collection: In retrospect, we could have explored additional sources of data or considered collecting supplementary data ourselves to enhance the richness and depth of our analysis.

Overall, Milestone 2 was a productive phase in our project journey, laying a solid foundation for subsequent data analysis and modeling activities. Moving forward, we will continue to refine our dataset and leverage it to derive meaningful insights into the relationship between social media usage and mental health.
