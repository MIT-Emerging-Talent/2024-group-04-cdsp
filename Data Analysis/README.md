## Project Overview

Our project explores the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes. As social media becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding its impact on mental well-being is crucial. We aim to contribute to existing knowledge by conducting a comprehensive analysis of this correlation.

## Problem Statement

Human beings are inherently social and rely on connections with others to alleviate stress, anxiety, and sadness. However, virtual connections through social media platforms have become ubiquitous, with 62.3% of the global population engaging in social media for an average of 2 hours and 23 minutes daily (as of January 2024). While social media offers benefits, experts are concerned about its potential negative impact on mental health, particularly among younger demographics. Mental health, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), is essential for individuals to cope with life's challenges, fulfill their potential, and contribute to society. This project aims to explore the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes.

## Actionable Data Questions

To assess the impact of social media on mental health, we consider factors associated with mental health issues such as anxiety and sleep disturbances:

- Correlation between occupation status and average daily social media usage
- Effect of average daily social media usage on feelings of depression
- Correlation between age, social media usage, and mental health outcomes
- Gender differences in social media usage and its impact on mental health
- Relationship between social media usage and focus problems
- Correlation between social media usage and feelings of worry and anxiety
- Relationship between concentration difficulties and social media usage

## Data

- **Source Data:** Kaggle - Social Media and Mental Health Dataset
- **Data Acquisition:** The data was gathered through a survey conducted from 04/18/2022 to 11/12/2022.

## Data Analysis

**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

**Data Cleaning:** Qualitative data was transformed into quantitative. Entries with non-entries were corrected.

## Results and Evaluation

This study analyzed a dataset from an online survey focusing on the correlation between social media usage and mental health issues. While the average time spent on social media per day showed a low correlation with mental health problems, attachment to social media, particularly aspects related to social media addiction, showed moderate correlations with certain mental health issues such as difficulty concentrating and being easily distracted. However, seeking validation from social media features and feeling depressed or down showed a low correlation with social media-related variables.
