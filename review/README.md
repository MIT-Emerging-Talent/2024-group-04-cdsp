## Review of Group 6 Repository:

- The repository appears to be well-structured, with a concise summary and thoughtful retrospective questions, even though they didn't reflect on the questions.
- There is ambiguity in problem identification, making it difficult to understand clearly.
- The data seems to be well analyzed with graphical representation, but the lack of a brief data summary hinders full comprehension of the analysis.
