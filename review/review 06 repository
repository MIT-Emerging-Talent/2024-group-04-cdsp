Review of group 6 repository 
• The repository appears to be well-structured, with a concise summary and thoughtful retrospective questions, even though they didn't reflect on the questions.
•There is ambiguity in problem identification, we couldn't understand it clearly.
• the data seems well analyzed with graphical representation but the lack of a brief data summary hinders full comprehension of the analysis.
