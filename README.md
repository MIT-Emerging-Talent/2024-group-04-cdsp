#### This is a Collaborative Data Science project within the Emerging Talent program. For many of us in this group, it marks our first venture into this field. Our primary goal is to learn effective collaboration despite challenges such as varying time zones and remote work, utilizing diverse tools. Additionally, we aim to explore the synergy between data science methodologies and domain expertise to foster new insights. Our focus is on translating these insights into practical real-world solutions.

## Problem Statement
#### Human beings are inherently social and rely on connections with others to alleviate stress, anxiety, and sadness, with a lack of social interaction posing significant risks to mental health. Today, virtual connections through social media platforms have become ubiquitous. A staggering 62.3% of the global population engages with social media, spending an average of 2 hours and 23 minutes daily (as of January 2024). While social media offers various positive benefits, experts express concerns over its potential negative impact on mental health, particularly among younger demographics. Mental health, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), is essential for individuals to effectively cope with life's challenges, fulfill their potential, and contribute to society. This project aims to explore the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes.


## Actionable data questions
#### To assess the impact of social media on mental health, we consider factors associated with mental health issues such as anxiety and sleep disturbances
#### 1.Correlation between occupation status and average time spent on social media every day?
#### 2. How much average time spent on social media may affect feeling down and depressed?
#### 3.How does age correlate with the amount of time spent on social media and mental health outcomes?
#### 4. Is there a difference in social media usage and its impact on mental health between genders
#### 5.Is there a correlation between time spent on social media and focus problems
#### 6.Is there any correlation between the time spent on social media and being worried and anxious
#### 7.What is the relationship between concentration difficulties and social media usage
